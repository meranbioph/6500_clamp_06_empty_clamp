Case clamp_05 was built on top of clamp_05 and the clampPimpleFoam-2 solver.

The main addition is the clamp cover cellZone and porosity conditions.

Includes
- two joined temperature equations: Tf and Ts.
- transient, incompressible, turbulent.
- fixed time step.
- cover cellZone

Does not include:
- variable inlet conditions
